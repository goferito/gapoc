### What is this thing about
I was just curious if it is really possible to take anyone's google analytics
tracking ID and use it to send page views events and custom events from
localhost or any different domains, and easily altering the insights
someone can get within Google Analytics.


### How to use it

1. Clone the repository
2. `npm install`
3. `gulp`



*I don't take resposability for how this tool may be used*
